## How to run the Different_visualization examples 

Each folder in the repo is a different model of a variation of Conway's Game of Life (including the folder 'game-of-life', which is the vanilla GoL). To run each of the models, run

```bash
cd _name_of_the_example
python3 _name_of_the_example.py
```
PS: You may need to install the dependencies separately to run the project. Some dependencies include (but are not limited to) flask, matplotlib, numpy, matplotlib. To install a dependency, open the project repo and in your terminal, run

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install _dependecy_
```
